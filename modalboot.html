The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit. The efficient-market hypothesis suggests that stock prices reflect all currently available information and any price changes that are not based on newly revealed information thus are inherently unpredictable.
                        Others disagree and those with this viewpoint possess myriad methods and technologies which purportedly allow them to gain future price. With the advent of the digital computer, stock market prediction has since moved into the technological realm. The most prominent technique involves the use of artificial neural networks. ANNs can be thought of as mathematical function approximators.Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value                 of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange.
